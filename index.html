<h4 style="text-indent: 30px;">What is NATO?</h4>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
    NATO, or the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, is a military and political alliance established in 1949 to ensure the collective defense of its member countries. Headquartered in Brussels, Belgium, it currently includes 32 member nations from North America and Europe. The core principle of NATO is collective security, meaning that an attack on one member is considered an attack on all. This was famously invoked after the September 11 attacks in 2001. Originally formed to counter the Soviet threat during the Cold War, NATO now addresses a wide range of security challenges, including terrorism, cyber threats, and global instability, through joint military exercises, strategic planning, and international cooperation.

<h4 style="text-indent: 30px;">History of NATO</h4>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
    NATO was established on April 4, 1949, with the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty in Washington, D.C. The 12 founding members were Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The alliance was created in response to the growing threat posed by the Soviet Union after World War II. Its primary purpose was to provide collective security against Soviet expansionism, prevent the resurgence of nationalist militarism in Europe, and encourage European political integration. Over the years, NATO has expanded to include 32 member countries and has adapted to address new security challenges in the post-Cold War era.

<h4 style="text-indent: 30px;">NATO's Role Today</h4>
<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
    Today, NATO continues to play a crucial role in maintaining international peace and security. The alliance conducts joint military exercises, engages in crisis management operations, and collaborates with partner countries to address emerging threats such as cyber attacks and terrorism. NATO also supports democratic values and works to promote stability in regions facing conflict. Recent initiatives include supporting Ukraine in its defense against Russian aggression and enhancing collective defense measures in response to evolving global security dynamics.
